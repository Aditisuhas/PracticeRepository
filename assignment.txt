How CI can improve the software development process:

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that emphasizes frequently integrating code changes into a 
shared repository, where automated builds and tests are executed to verify the integration’s correctness. As organizations 
strive for efficiency and high-quality software delivery, CI has become a pivotal component in modern software development workflows. 
Reflecting on its impact, it’s clear that CI offers multiple improvements across the development lifecycle, from enhancing collaboration 
to ensuring higher software quality.

1.Early Detection of Bugs and Issues
2.Improved Code Quality
3.Faster Feedback Loops
4.Enhanced Deployment Pipeline
